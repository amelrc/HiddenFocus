		Four artists, three Cuban and one Canadian, have come together to share the
		work they have rendered in painting, paper and photography. The expo
		celebrates the inner life of our cities and the bountiful nature that
		nurtures and surrounds them. Together, they invite us to reflect on the
		broad range of experiences that we share in common, and that lay the
		foundation for a life lived in harmony.

		Lilia Ulla was a teenager at the time of the Revolution, and has experienced
		firsthand the remaking of Cuban society as it unfolded over the decades.
		Through her eyes, we could still catch a glimpse of Havanaâ€™s former
		splendor.
		<br />
		<br />
		Affectionately known as Dr. Lilly, she introduced Lawrence and me to many of
		her friends, including Amel, Boris and Abel. New friendships quickly
		developed, and Lilia happily and capably took charge of making this expo
		happen.
